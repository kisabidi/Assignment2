    <h2>SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
    <div><br/>
     
        <br/>
        We will provide a web based school management system for school of any scale where students
        can view their attendance and marks, where teacher's don't have to keep records of marks,
        grades and attendance on multiple sheets, and where administration is not worried
        about keeping record of the students,
        Faculty and the fee management issue.
